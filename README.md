# object_tracking_with_stepper_motor.py
object detecting with YOLOv8 real time detection,getting axis coordinats from the real time detcectiong using that coordinats getting step and direction of step motor that how many it would be stepped
using NMA stepper motor and drivers Pins are to use that motor En,Dir,step,dirac(optional),3.3V and Gnd pins are used
